# Cozy Town: RUN 4 report

Branches `claude/run-4-s1` (stage 1), `claude/run-4-s2` (stage 2, from s1), `claude/run-4-s3` (stage 3, from s2); one commit per job, pushed at once. Starting file: index.html md5 `709bf763d51be0160c118e2f9249f9f6` (1,355,180 bytes, night 3, COZY_BUILD 2026101701), kept as `tools/prerun4-index.html`. Check kit: version 6 (`cozy-check-v6.zip`, made from 5.1: a stage "run4" with lines N15 to N41, every line starts as FAIL; the one clock in the test pages; the B1 one-clock rule; N1/N6/N10/N14 rewritten to the owner's 17 Oct design).

(filled in after every job; if the session restarts: undo any half-done job, carry on from the next one)

## 1. Every change, old → new

### Job 1: One clock for everyone (items 15, 2; the owner's decision 17 Oct)
- Old: each device had its own game clock (saved in the save, paused when nobody played), friends pulled each other's clocks forward (mpClock / clockFrom / clockJump, the 30-day rule), the night skipped to 7:00 when everyone was in bed (zzSkip), and "Day N" showed in the clock chip, the phone, the calendar, messages and the morning line.
- New: game time is ONE formula of the real time: `clockAt(realMs())`, a game day = 15 real minutes at the old speed (7:00–21:00 in 600 s, 21:00–7:00 in 300 s), days counted from 1 Jan 2026 UTC. `realMs()` = the device clock + an offset from the web server's Date header, read whenever the update check fetches index.html (`clockServer`; the Claude version has none). The frame loop only reads the clock (`clockSync`); at midnight `newDay()` runs once (never a loop over skipped days). The day number is never shown: the chip says "9:40 Wed", the phone "Wednesday", the calendar app a week of weekday names, messages "Wed · 9:40", the Move-my-game cards drop the day. An old save jumps once at load (`clockLoad`): plants watered on a day that passed finish growing (`dayJump`), the day's quests are drawn fresh, daily counters reset, the Pet Show week and the bus timetable follow the shared day; nothing else in the save changes (B1 rule in the kit). Load time of the day-58 save: 138 ms (the designer card's theme photo is now drawn right after the load, not inside it: it took 7 s on a chip without a GPU).
- Beds: from 21:00 you lie down and a soft sleep screen shows 💤, "23:40 · Wed", "Sleeping until 7:00 🌙" and a 48 px "🌅 Wake up" button; at 7:00 "Good morning! It's Wed ☀️". No skip; the "😴 2 of 3 in bed" card and the phone ring are gone. The away timer ("Still there?") does not count while you sleep.
- The Welcome Bus (free, both ways) comes on a new player's first day on the one clock: from the next 10 minutes after Rosie's welcome for 4 game hours (from 8:00 if early; the next morning 8:00–12:00 if it is 17:00 or later), saved as `wb:[day, comes, leaves]`.
- Presence no longer carries `ck` (old versions keep their own clocks and see new players normally).
- Item 2 (rain under a blue sky), the root cause: the old sky only went 60–70% grey in rain (#74a1cb at noon: still blue) and the rain lines started in the first minutes of a weather change while the sky was still blue (the fade mixed both at once). New: WX_SKY palettes (cloudy, rain, snow; dark grey at night); the sky is fully grey after the first 40% of a change (smoothstep), rain and snow only fall once the mix is past 30%, the sun sprite hides in grey weather. Proved at 8:00, 12:00, 18:00 and 23:00 (N16) and through a real sunny→rain change minute by minute.
- The title screen's sky follows the real time of day too.

### Job 2: The same game for everyone (items 27, 26, 25)
- Updates (item 27): a newer file found while playing is now taken by itself at the next calm moment (`updCalm`: never during a card, a scene, a class, the Pet Show, the claw machine, the bus, a photo shoot, a dance round, a scare on the spooky path, typing, in bed, decorating, on the stairs or in the character maker). A "✨ Updating Cozy Town… your game is saved 💾" note shows first (1.4 s), then the game saves and reloads. The loop guard stays (at most once per version per session; a version already tried only shows the button). The title keeps its old behaviour.
- Old-version players: presence now carries `v` (the version stamp). A friend with none or a smaller one shows "⏳ older version" after the name on the name tag and in the 👫 Friends list. Nothing else changes for them.
- Item 26 (a kitchen in the middle of the room on a friend's PC), the root cause: the visitor guessed the room size from the furniture spots: in a big house any piece within 70 cm of a wall (|x| > 5.3 or |z| > 4.3, e.g. a kitchen flush to the back wall at z −4.65) made the layout look like an old 18x14 room, so the visitor drew the old big room around a 12x10 layout and the kitchen stood 2 m from the wall. Now the layout says its room size (`hm.W`, `hm.D`), spots are sent to the centimetre (they were rounded to 10 cm), and only a layout that says no size (an old version) is guessed at. Old versions ignore the new fields.
- Item 25 (a window across the view on the stairs), the root cause: the west-wall window sat at z 0, exactly in the stair doorway of the big house (home and visit, downstairs and upstairs), so it hung across the view on the stairs; houses without stairs and old 18x14 layouts (windows at z −3.2 / 2.6) never had it, which is why only some players saw it. With stairs the west windows now sit at z ±3 (home, upstairs, visit). Proved by looking along the stair slope from the bottom, the middle and the top on both floors: nothing nearer than 3.9 m.
- Gardens: what you planted rides along in presence (`gd`: spot, seed, stage); friends see your soil and crops on your Friends Lane lot (old versions send and show nothing). The seed spots live in one list (`YARD_PLOTS`) for job 10.
- Item 27, everything others can see and where it comes from: time and weather (the one clock), holiday pieces and ghosts (built from fixed lists and seeded draws), trash spots (a seeded draw of the day), houses (big or not, from presence; floors and colour come with job 10), furniture (presence `hm`, now with the room size), gardens (presence `gd`), sitting, bed, jumps, pets and their outfits (presence), clothes and costumes (presence `lk`; costumes with job 3), name and version (presence). Local scenery that nobody shares and that is not the same on two devices: the townspeople walkers, cars, ducks, birds and butterflies (they wander on each device). Grandmas: the same places for everyone from job 8.

## 2. Check output per job, exactly as printed

### Job 1 (first run: B1 showed two kit gaps, both clock stamps: `home.old.t` is the moment this load shrank an old big house, and a pet's happiness drifts a little per frame like hunger; N15 showed the designer photo's 7 s inside the load, the test's own clocks drifting apart (one page's stepped time had run ahead), and that the day-58 save has no bed)
